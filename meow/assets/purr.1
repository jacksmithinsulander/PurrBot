NAME

purr — chat-first interface to the 9Lives on-chain prediction market

SYNOPSIS

/purr command [ args … ]
Telegram inline: @purrbot query

DESCRIPTION

purr pipes the power of 9Lives, “the most customisable and capital-efficient prediction market in the web3 ecosystem,” directly into a Telegram chat stream.

9Lives runs on Arbitrum Stylus smart contracts, giving Rust-level speed and ~10× cheaper gas than Solidity deployments.

Unlike older book-based markets, 9Lives fuses a continuous orderbook with a Dynamic Pari-Mutuel (DPM) pool or a Constant-Product AMM, yielding infinite on-chain liquidity while letting traders exit early.

Markets span Crypto, Opinion-Polls, Price-Prediction, Sports, Politics, Pop-Culture, and more, all visible through /markets.

Inventors may /create campaigns that lock an incentive stake and pick an oracle type; fees flow back to the inventor after settlement.

AI agents already operate on 9Lives, refining decision-making and scoring themselves against outcomes — expect purr to expose that data in future releases.
